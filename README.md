# gutenbox
Gutenbox is a translation of Project Gutenberg combined with public domain media files.

Our project is to perform machine translations of Project Gutenberg since the texts are not available in a number of languages, and human translation is expensive and costs serious time. Our philosophy is that 50,000 machine translated public domain books in a language is better than no public domain books at all.
