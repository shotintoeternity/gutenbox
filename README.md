# gutenbox
Gutenbox is a translation of Project Gutenberg combined with public domain media files.

Our project is to perform machine translations of Project Gutenberg since the texts are not available in a number of languages, and human translation is expensive and time-consuming. We are currently looking into translation APIs to translate these files into offline-friendly format.

Currently, due to the 6 GB+ size of Project Gutenberg, all of the books are not included in the repo. However, you can download them from the Project Gutenberg site here: https://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:Offline_Catalogs or view our mirror of the 2010 DVD at http://www.informationsoftwarellc.com/media/text/
